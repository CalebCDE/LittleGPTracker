INFO
================================

LittleGpTracker is an open source music tracker (program to create music) with an interface developed mainly for consoles (even GameBoy)

This version is based on the Dingux version published by gameblabla.

We don't know if the USB OTG input for MIDI is functional or not.

During the first startup a folder called "/media/home/.lgptr/" will be created on the internal microsd card because the application works only in its folder.

A theme has been created following the color scheme of the RG350 Black-Orange. 

Included a sample song: lgpt10k
